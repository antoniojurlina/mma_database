# Mixed Martial Arts Database

This is a repository of my initial attempts to gather data from several MMA promotions and organize it into one cohesive unit.

For UFC data, I scraped their official website, https://www.ufc.com/.

For Pride data, I scraped Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pride_FC_events.

This is an ongoing project that was put on hold due to more pressing obligations.
